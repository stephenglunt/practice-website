            <h2>I've always been a big fan of space.</h2>
            <p>I grew up watching Star Trek and Star Wars. It was never about which was better. I liked them both. But I
                always thought that Star Trek was a more plausible version of the future. After all, Star Wars is about
                the
                past. A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...</p>

            <h2>I also like photography.</h2>
            <p>I started getting into photography after having kids. I wanted a way to record their lives. I felt like
                there
                weren't enough photos of me when I was a kid. I also didn't want to spend a fortune on photos so it was
                fortunate that digital cameras became affordable right around that time. I've owned a couple of Canon
                DSLRs
                and a few good lenses.</p>

            <h2>Fitness is an essential part of my identity.</h2>
            <p>It started because I really idolized my older brother Matt. He was a talented gymnast and very
                charasmatic.
                Also, my best friend in early adolecense was an avid runner who was also athletically talented. He got
                me
                into track and cross country and because of that, running has been a part of who I am for the past 26
                years.
